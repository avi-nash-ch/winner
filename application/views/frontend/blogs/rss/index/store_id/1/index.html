      <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">School students come across multiple choices of subjects during their academic journey. In the school, they are given the ideas and knowledge of every subject in order to ensure their holistic development. Most countries have systems of formal education, which includes a range of subjects. In these systems, students progress and develop a basic knowledge of almost every subject that is necessary for leading the prosperous life. And during their schooling children develop a specific interest in a particular subject that they decide to pursue it in higher study.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">School students are naturally curious to learn new things and ask a series of questions until they get practical answers and there is none other than science that can practically prove the existence of the things and their concepts. Science allows students to explore their world and discover new things. It is one of the most active subjects that contain a range of hands-on activities including multiple steps experiments. It covers almost everything in the universe, which we can see or can't see. In the truest sense, nothing is beyond the field of science.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to a basic educational level, science has been divided into three broad subjects &ndash; Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. All three subjects are based on practical and experiments which are core to science. These subjects are not only for knowledge, but they are the fundamentals for the establishing a prosperous society. Even so, society and science cannot be ever separated into two distinct entities. This makes science one of the best subjects across the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, the major purpose of science education is to produce the specialist scientists, innovators, technologists and engineers, who can work for the welfare of their society. If you see around the world you can see hundreds of things, like an electric bulb, telephone, aeroplane, cars and much more that are making our lives prosperous and easy to go on.&nbsp; And how can we forget medicines that are the lifeline of the human. These things have been invented and produced by scientists which are now a vital part of our lives.</p>
